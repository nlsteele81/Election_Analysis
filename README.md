## Challenge Overview
For this challenge, I conducted an election audit of a local congressional election using Python to automate the process. I used Python to read and write CSV files with the election data and resulting data analysis. I was able to calculate the total number of votes cast in the election then analyze the votes cast to determine how many candidates received votes, how many votes each candidate received, and then calculate the percentage of votes received for each candidate. Based on these findings, I was able to determine the winner of the election and report the results.

## Challenge Summary
In this election, three candidates received votes: Charles Casper Stockham, Diane DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane. A total of 369,711 votes were cast in the election. Of these votes, Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes corresponding to 23.0% of total votes, Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes corresponding to 73.8% of total votes cast, and Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes corresponding to 3.1% of total votes cast. Thus, Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the total votes cast with 272,892 votes, was the winner of the election based on the popular vote.
